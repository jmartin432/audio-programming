# Audio Programming #
These is a collection of projects that were completed for a class on Audio 
Programming, part of the Certificate in Creative Coding and Immersive 
Technologies Program at Portland Community College.

I chose to do these projects in PureData.

Thanks for checking out my GitHub.
